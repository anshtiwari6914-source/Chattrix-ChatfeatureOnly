            <p>
                Chattrix is the ultimate platform for college students to meet, chat, and connect—anonymously and safely. Unlike regular random chat apps, Chattrix is designed exclusively for students, making it easier to find peers who share your campus vibes, interests, and energy.
            </p>

            <p>
                We designed Chattrix with a strong focus on simplicity, privacy, and creativity. 
                Every element — from the sleek interface to the fast matching system — exists to keep you 
                in the moment rather than the menus.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Values</h2>

            <ul class="values">
                <li><span>🟠 Openness:</span> Anyone can join a conversation, anytime.</li>
                <li><span>🛡️ Safety:</span> Built-in protections keep your experience respectful.</li>
                <li><span>⚡ Speed:</span> Lightning-fast matching with minimal waiting.</li>
                <li><span>🌍 Global Community:</span> Meet people from different universities instantly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why We Built Chattrix</h2>

            <p>
                The world is loud with notifications but quiet with real human connection. 
                Chattrix was created to bring back that spark — the joy of talking to someone new, 
                discovering unexpected conversations, and feeling genuinely heard.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Promise</h2>
            <p>
                We continue improving Chattrix to keep it safe, modern, and fun.  
                Your feedback shapes the platform — because Chattrix isn’t just a service.  
                It’s a shared space, crafted with the people who use it.
            </p>
